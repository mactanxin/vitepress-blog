# Hello There ðŸ‘‹

ðŸš§ new blog in progress. 

I often spend many hours solving a complex problem and have a terrible habit of forgetting to document how exactly I solved it. After a few months passed, I stumbled into the same situation again. Because I didnâ€™t document it, I need to dedicate hours to solve it with the minimal amount of context I have from the previous attempt.
